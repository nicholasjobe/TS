	<p><center><strong><h1>Social Media</h1></strong></center></p>
<p>As previously discussed in the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jp5mzk/transmedia-shows-are-winning-the-internet"><i>Transmedia Shows Winning the Internet</i></a> article, social media can be used in ways such as characters in a story having their own social media accounts and interacting with each other and/or regular people.</p>
<p><i>Hello from the Magic Tavern</i> is an adult improv fantasy/comedy podcast that tells the story of a man named Arnie who ends up in the magical world of Foon (think Narnia/Middle Earth) and just so happened to have his podcasting equipment with him. The story is shaped improvisationally by the main characters and guests, who are interviewed on the show as characters themselves.</p>
<p>The primary characters have emails and social media accounts, where they can post and share what they please, in character. The show is also interactive, where listeners have interacted with the story by sending the characters packages, emails, and audio clips as well as viewed/participated in live performances at podcasting conventions. You can click on the logo below to visit their website:</p>
