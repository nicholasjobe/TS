	<p><center><strong><h1>Stage Magic</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>Everyone knows stage magic. Famous examples of stage magicians include David Copperfield, Criss Angel, Penn & Teller, and more (though all of whom also perform close-up). Stage magic, essentially, are bigger, grander illusions that require the audience to be further away for the trick to succeed. These usually involve props, sometimes seemingly dangerous, which can hurt, levitate, disappear, re-appear, and generally do the impossible on a bigger, more visual scale.</p>
	<p>While I do own and have performed some stage magic for small audiences, it is definitely not my forte. I find it more difficult to practice and, although there are some great tricks and illusions in stage magic, I prefer the smaller scale of close-up.</p>
