	<p><center><strong><h1>Adjectives & Adverbs</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>Adjectives & Adverbs are never necessary in a sentence. They do add detail that can be helpful. These are both descriptive types of words. Adjectives describe nouns and pronouns. Adverbs describe verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Also, many adverbs end in -ly. First, let us look at some types of adjectives in a sentence:</p>
		<p>The car is blue.</p>
		<p>He is short and fat.</p>
		<p>There is a fuzzy dog in the smelly bathroom.</p>
		<p>In these sentences, <em>blue</em>, <em>short</em>, <em>fat</em>, <em>fuzzy</em>, and <em>smelly</em> are all adjectives and describe nouns and pronouns, <em>car</em>, <em>he</em>, <em>dog</em>, and <em>bathroom</em>. The following table gives more examples of adverbs:</p>
		<p>The man jumps high.</p>
		<p>The cheetah runs quickly.</p>
		<p>The turtle walks very slowly.</p>
		<p>The girl is very pretty.</p>
		<p>The adverbs in these sentences were <em>high</em>, which describes the verb <em>jumps</em>; <em>quickly</em>, which describes the verb <em>runs</em>; <em>very</em>, which describes the adverb <em>slowly</em>, which itself describes the verb <em>run</em>; and <em>very</em>, which in this case describes the adjective <em>pretty</em>. The following chart gives more examples of adjectives and adverbs:</p>
