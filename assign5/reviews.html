		<p><center><strong>Ninja Escape (Seattle, WA) - Stuck in a Room with a Zombie (July 2019)</strong></center></p>
	<p>My wife and I have done a number of escape rooms around the country. While in Seattle, we originally wanted to do the original US escape company, Puzzle Break, but we ended up coming to Ninja Escape instead. And I'm glad we did! Despite missing our turn and ending up getting there late, they were super understanding and accommodating and went right into everything as soon as we got there.</p>
<p>We did Stuck in a Room with a Zombie, an escape room classic we had never gotten around to yet. It was just the two of us--nobody else signed up in our time slot. Tim (I believe is his name) said it would be very difficult to pull it off with only two of us, so he stayed in the room and gave us a ton of hints over the next hour. Sadly, we didn't escape, but we were just one set of clues short of finishing (thanks to Tim, as it was pretty difficult for just two of us!). And we could have probably figured it out if it weren't for that pesky zombie!</p>
<p>Speaking of, the zombie element was fantastic and added a whole new layer of strategic playing. It's like you're playing an hour-long game of tag where you have to not get touched, but the "it" person gets a better reach every 5 minutes. And I can't go without a huge shout-out to the zombie actor, Logan, who was amazing (we totally meant to tip you, Logan, and both forgot in the bustle of leaving and winding down from the game. So if you do this, please tip your zombie!). I can't imagine the physicality required of running and flopping around on the floor for an hour while staying in character and giving subtle clues throughout and never seeming out of breath or tired.</p>
