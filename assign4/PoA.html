	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> is the third book of the franchise and a fan favorite, as it is the introduction to some important characters as well as the first time the series really gets into the backstory of some adult characters.</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> After Harry accidentally inflates his Aunt Marge, he runs away from home and stumbles upon the Knight Bus, a magical three-decker bus. It's here he first learns of Sirius Black, whom he later finds out has escaped from Azkaban Prison--something nobody has ever done before--and that he might be coming after Harry. Harry also meets Remus Lupin, the newest professor at Hogwarts, who is a disheveled though kind man who mentors Harry into learning the advanced Patronus Charm so Harry can protect himself against Dementors, the terrifying wraith-like Azkaban guards who are looking for Sirius at Hogwarts while also having a unique draw toward Harry.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Kid Characters Introduced:</strong> n/a</p>
	<p><strong>Important Adult Characters Introduced:</strong>Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew, Professor Trelawney, and Stan Shunpike.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Non-Human Characters Introduced:</strong> Buckbeak (hippogriff).</p>
		<p><strong>Important Objects Introduced:</strong> Maurader's Map, the Knight Bus, time-turners, and the Firebolt broom.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Places Introduced:</strong> Hogsmeade and the Shrieking Shack</p>
		
		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>This is a movie that splits many fans. Most movie-only fans consider this film their favorite of the franchise, while book-fans deride it for cutting out vital information (such as any of the backstory or explanation, removing the purpose the story was even written), creating plot holes, and breaking the rules of the world (Harry doing underage magic at the Dursley's five minutes before mentioning no underage magic is allowed outside of Hogwarts--a major issue in the books). The director, Alfonso Cuaron, also set a precedent in the films to focus solely on Harry's story and cutting out everything else, which sadly removed many great scenes or even entire plot points in later films. This is the first film to feature Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, and he would play him for the remainder of the franchise.</p>
