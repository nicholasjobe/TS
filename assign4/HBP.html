	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em> is the sixth book in the franchise and completely shifts gears from the previous book. While Harry had been angry and emotional in the fifth book, which was itself dark, gloomy, and upsetting, the sixth book balances its dark and tragic Voldemort backstory with a romantic comedy subplot.</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Voldemort has now been publically outed as being back; the minister of magic, Cornelius Fudge, has been replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour; and Dumbledore wants to do special lessons with Harry to teach him about Voldemort's history and how he's connected to Horace Slughorn, the potions professor who has returned to Hogwarts under Dumbledore's request. Slughorn knows something Harry needs to discover, something that could help Harry and Dumbledore in their battle against Voldemort. Something called Horcruxes.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, Ron has become infatuated with Lavender Brown, much to Hermione's annoyance, and has also made it onto the Gryffindor Quidditch team, of which Harry is now captain. Harry has also turned his eye toward Ginny Weasley now that his relationship with Cho has fallen apart.</p>
		<p>During all of this, Harry has discovered an old potions book saying it belongs to the Half-Blood Prince, which has annotations that make Harry look like he's a potions master. He also starts obsessing over Draco, who has begun acting more strange than usual, looking more and more sickly as the year goes on, and attempting something that will not end up well.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Kid Characters Introduced:</strong> Lavender Brown (technically has been around since the first book, but she becomes prominent here) and Cormac McLaggen.</p>
	<p><strong>Important Adult Characters Introduced:</strong> Horace Slughorn, the Gaunt family, the Riddle family, Rufus Scrimgeour, and Fenrir Greyback.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Non-Human Characters Introduced:</strong> Inferi (magic-based zombies).</p>
		<p><strong>Important Objects Introduced:</strong> Horcruxes, R.A.B. locket, resurrection stone, and Felix Felicis.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Places Introduced:</strong> The Gaunt house and the cave.</p>
		
		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>While the <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> film is generally received positively, it does have two major criticisms from both sides of the fan spectrum. First, almost all of Voldemort's backstory and the explanation of the Horcruxes was removed from the film, taking away most of the interesting information from the book. The final films handle Horcruxes differently than the books, however, making this change more annoying to fans than detrimental. Second, the film barely focuses on the Half-Blood Prince, both the book and the character, making the ultimate reveal feel awkward and more of a "...ok?" moment.</p>
