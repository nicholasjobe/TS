	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em> is the fifth and longest book in the franchise at well over 800 pages. It is also the book author JK Rowling has admitted she would go back and edit down if she had the chance. It is considered one of the harder books to get through due to its size and seemingly unimportant scenes (an entire chapter on cleaning a house, for example--only relevant for an off-hand, half-sentence comment that doesn't come back for two more books).</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Harry, and only Harry, is 100% sure that Voldemort has returned, and almost nobody--including the Ministry of Magic--believes him, except his friends and Dumbledore. When Harry saves his cousin Dudley from a rogue Dementor attack, he is summoned on trial for his underage magic use in the presence of muggles (non-magic folk). Harry ends up able to go back to Hogwarts only to find it being infiltrated and controlled by the Ministry in the form of Dolores Umbridge, a woman who might be more unbearable that Voldemort himself. With everything in disarray, Harry takes things into his own hands and starts Dumbledore's Army, a secret club of students practicing Defense Against the Dark Arts since Umbridge refuses to.</p>

		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>While the book is the longest in the series, the film is the shortest. Unlike the previous two films, however, the majority of the cuts or changes worked for the adaptation. For example, all Quidditch was removed from the film, which cut out at least half of the book that wasn't needed. Many of the unnecessary scenes from the book were either removed or altered, giving the film a more concise and streamlined feeling. There were fan-favorite scenes missing from the film as well as important plot details (almost all Neville-related, plus the massive truncation of the Department of Mysteries climax). Outside of that, the casting of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge was spot-on, and Daniel Radcliffe's acting definitely stepped up, making this one of the best films in the franchise. Director David Yates would go on to direct the rest of the films in the franchise as well as the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> spin-off films.</p>
