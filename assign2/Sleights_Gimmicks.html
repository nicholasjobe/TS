	<p><center><strong><h1>Sleights & Gimmicks</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>In magic, there are two styles of tricks: sleight of hand and gimmicks. That being said, however, many gimmicks still require some sleight of hand to avoid revealing the secret of the gimmick. Sleight of hand magic takes many years of practice and skill to get down, though it is the most impressive once you can do it well. Gimmicks are purchased, pre-made tricks that basically have the trick built into it without being noticeable. Both have their place in magic, in my opinion, and gimmicks can still take a lot of practice to get down smoothly without giving anything away.</p>
