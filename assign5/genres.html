	<p><center><strong><h1>Genres</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>Every escape room has a genre or themes. This can be anything from drama to sci-fi to horror. The genre ties everything together and should give puzzles that are thematic to that genre. For example, you wouldn't want modern day or futuristic technology in an old west-themed room. It would take you out of the immersion. One of the first majorly popular genres was horror, in particular, <em>Trapped in a Room with a Zombie</em>. In this style room, an actor playing a zombie is chained up and every so often, the chain gets a little longer, making it more difficult to get to clues, because you're also trying to avoid being touched by the zombie. These types are not the norm, however. While actors are used occasionally, most often you will be in a room with just your group and help will come over a TV screen or an intercom if necessary.</p>
