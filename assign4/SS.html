<p><em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</em>, or as it's known everywhere else in the world, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em>, is the first book in the franchise. It introduced audiences to the Wizarding World.</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> The story follows Harry Potter, a boy who lives with his abusive aunt, uncle, and cousin, who--on his 11th birthday--finds out he's a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, he also discovers he's actually rich and famous, having been the only survivor of Voldemort, a dark wizard who killed Harry's parents and attempted to kill him, though it backfired, leaving only a lightning-shaped scar on Harry's forehead.</p>
		<p>At Hogwarts, Harry meets his best friends, Ron and Hermione, as well as bully and rival Draco Malfoy. They uncover the mystery of the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone and how it might be connected to Harry's past.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Kid Characters Introduced:</strong> Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Neville, Fred and George, Percy, Dudley, and many other schoolmates</p>
	<p><strong>Important Adult Characters Introduced:</strong>Dumbledore, Hagrid, McGonagall, Snape, Quirrell, Voldemort, Molly Weasley, Vernon and Petunia, Ollivander, and other professors.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Non-Human Characters Introduced:</strong> Hedwig (owl), Scabbers (rat), Firenze (centaur), Nearly Headless Nick (ghost), Peeves (Poltergeist), and other ghosts.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Objects Introduced:</strong> Invisibility Cloak, the Nimbus 2000 broom, the Golden Snitch, Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone, Chocolate Frog Dumbledore card, flying motorcycle, the Mirror of Erised, and the Deluminator.</p>

		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>The movie cast some of the UK's best adult actors alongside new child actors, a couple of whom have gone on to become big stars (Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (Hermione) in particular). With a few minor exceptions, this book-to-film adaptation is very close to the original material. A few tidbits of information and minor characters (such as Peeves the Poltergeist) were cut from the final film. However, the film still hits the major points, sets up the overall world, and delivers what it needed to to set up the film franchise.</p>
