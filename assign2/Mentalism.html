	<p><center><strong><h1>Mentalism</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>Mentalism is a different beast entirely. Many magicians separate magic and mentalism into two different arts altogether. Magic is far more visual, and while magic is highly psychological, mentalism is purely psychological. To be a good mentalist, in fact, you have to be able to entertain almost purely with words as you get into the participants' heads. Mentalism, for lack of a better description, is a type of magic that allows the performer to know or learn information that should be impossible to know. This can be words in a book, phone numbers, phone codes, names, randomized letters or digits, and more. Magician and mentalist Chris Ramsay has stated that once you begin performing mentalism for an audience, you should never go back to things like card tricks. Mentalism is on a different playing field and causes the audience to see you differently. Once you show you can read minds, finding a lost card or the like just isn't the same.</p>

	<p>I have dabbled in mentalism, and it is definitely fun to perform if you can pull it off. It requires a level of charisma or overall presence to invest the audience that you can really read their minds. It is also hard to practice, as you can't really know if the trick works without another person. You can't read someone's mind alone in front of a mirror.</p>
