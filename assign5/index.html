	<p><center><strong><h1>Escape Rooms</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>Escape rooms began in Japan as a real-life version of puzzle-based video games of the same variety. They quickly expanded into other parts of Asia and Europe and, eventually, the United States. The first US escape room company was called Puzzle Break in Seattle, Washington. It has now spread throughout the entire US and gained popularity, changing from an underground phenomenon to a pop culture one. While many think it's just a fad, it has been going on worldwide over a decade with no signs of slowing down.</p>
		<p>Escape rooms are essentially this: two or more people (usually bigger groups, and entirely dependent on the room itself) work together in a specifically thematic room to meet the final goal (unlocking a door, finding an object, etc.) in usually under an hour. While sometimes offered clues, groups are typically put into rooms without any idea of what to do first. The search begins for puzzles and clues that can be put together to open locks, which leads to more clues, until everything is solved. Escape rooms may only be played once. Once you've played one room, you can't play that same room again, even at a sister branch of the same company.</p>
		<p>There are also common rules amongst all escape room businesses. The worker will go over these rules before you enter the room. There is also usually a waiver or agreement you have to sign before going in, which also explains things. Rules and guidelines, for the most part, are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>There's nothing in the ceiling--no need to check.</li>
		<li>If it has a certain sticker on it, don't mess with it (like outlets).</li>
		<li>If an object doesn't open easily, don't force it or it could break.</li>
		<li>Don't break anything.</li>
		<li>If there is an actor in the room, do not touch them.</li>
		<li>Unless otherwise told, there's no need to climb on or flip over large furniture.</li>
		<li>No phones or outside electronics are allowed.</li>
		<li>Please arrive early, especially if you're with another group of people (unless you buy out a room, it is likely that you will be mixed with strangers who have also booked spots in the room).</li>
	</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is never any actual danger or locked doors at any time.</p>
