	<p><center><strong><h1>The Book</h1></strong></center></p>
		<p><center><img src="../GoFCover.jpg" width="245" height="350" alt=""/></center></p>
	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em> is the fourth book in the franchise and the first "tome-size" book of the series, greatly increasing in size and scope. This is the book where, by the end, the entire franchise has changed and begins growing darker in tone and subject matter. It is also the first book to feature a chapter Harry is not in at all (the closest prior being the first chapter of the first book, though baby Harry shows up at the end).</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Harry, Ron, and Hermione go with the Weasleys to the Quidditch World Cup, which is interrupted by Death Eaters--followers of Voldemort. Back at Hogwarts, Harry discovers they are hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, where three major magic schools come together to compete in this grand event. Although nobody under the age of 17 can enter, Harry's name somehow gets entered and chosen as Hogwart's second champion after Cedric Diggory, causing uproar. With some help from classmates, Dobby, and Mad-Eye Moody--the newest Hogwarts professor--Harry has to try and survive the three tasks while dodging annoying reporter Rita Skeeter and getting a date for the Yule Ball.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Kid Characters Introduced:</strong> Cedric Diggory and Cho Chang (both technically introduced in earlier books, but mostly as an off-hand mention during Quidditch), Victor Krum, and Fleur Delacour.</p>
	<p><strong>Important Adult Characters Introduced:</strong> Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, Bill and Charlie Weasley (though both mentioned earlier), Madame Maxime, Igor Karkaroff, Rita Skeeter, Barty Crouch Sr., Barty Crouch Jr., Ludo Bagman, and various Death Eaters.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Non-Human Characters Introduced:</strong> Winky (house-elf), veela (species), mermaids (species), and dragons.</p>
		<p><strong>Important Objects Introduced:</strong> The Goblet of Fire, Portkeys, Veritaserum, the pensieve, and Priori Incantatem (an event due to wands).</p>
		<p><strong>Important Places Introduced:</strong> Quidditch World Cup, Durmstrang, Beauxbaton, and the cemetery.</p>
		
		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>The movie is similar in its splitting of fans--many film-only fans love it more than book-fans. However, the film either cut out or changed the majority of the book, with only the climactic scene being mostly accurate (though even that had some controversy). The director, Mike Newell, wanted to turn this long, detailed mystery book into a fast-paced action film, and thus had to remove over half the book and make changes due to those cuts. These cuts and changes also affected later films, which were now stuck being unable to share other plot details because they weren't set up here. Most infamously, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is considered too angry in this film, going so far as to even violently accuse Harry of putting his name into the Goblet--an action outside of Dumbledore's personality. The film also introduced the concept of wand locking during battle, something that specifically should not happen outside of Harry and Voldemort's wands--a major plot point ignored for the remainder of the franchise.</p>
