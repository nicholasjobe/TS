	<p><center><strong><h1>The Book</h1></strong></center></p>
		<p><center><img src="../CoSCover.jpg" width="245" height="350" alt=""/></center></p>
	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em> is the second book in the franchise and picks up about a month or so after the end of the previous book. It expands on the world, plot, and characters in a way that doesn't feel like the same story or adventure twice in a row.</p>
	<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Harry, miserably at home with the Dursleys (his aunt, uncle, and cousin), gets a visit from a house-elf named Dobby, who is trying to ruin his chances of returning to Hogwarts. Someone is setting out to kill Harry this coming school year. When he returns to Hogwarts, however, strange things begin happening, such as bloody words on the wall saying the "Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemy of the Heir Beware." Everyone thinks Harry might be behind this, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to find the real heir before someone dies.</p>

		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p>The movie has gotten flack for including too much material from the book. Although it doesn't include every little detail or scene from the book, it included enough to make it a long and drawn out movie that displeased a lot of movie-only fans and some book fans. This led to how the following adaptation mindset occurred, which I will discuss with the third movie. This was the last film directed by Chris Columbus and the last film for Richard Harris to play Dumbledore, as he would pass away between movies.</p>
