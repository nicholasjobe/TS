<p>So you know what transmedia storytelling is--now what? How do you actually put together a transmedia story for students? You might think "I'll show the movie after we read the book." And, well, you wouldn't be wrong, per se, but that would be one of the least interesting and least effective ways to utilize transmedia storytelling.</p>
<p>One of the biggest drawbacks to transmedia storytelling is that it takes time--something educators do not have in droves. So, ideally, you have two paths to follow here: take the time and effort to put it together yourself, or have your students create it themselves. I will explain both.</p>
	<p><center><h2>Teacher Created</h2></center></p>
<p>While this method takes more time and preparation, if done correctly, it can be quite rewarding. The first thing you need to do is answer this question: What are you needing to teach? Transmedia storytelling works best with more complex or abstract concepts that kids and teens might struggle with more than an average concept. For example, say you're trying to teach emotions or character traits to lower elementary students. Because these are abstract concepts, they could be more easily explained through various media.</p>
	<p>The following are examples of what can be done:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>show a clip from Pixar's <i>Inside Out</i>;</li>
		<li>read a book from the same franchise;</li>
		<li>play instrumental music from the film and discuss how the music makes them feel;</li>
		<li>create an easy game involving cut-outs or characters;</li>
		<li>find a printable of a social media website and figure out what the different emotions, as living characters, would say or post on said social media (depending on age of students).</li>
	</ul>
		<p>All of these would work together to tell the story of emotions while teaching the kids these concepts.</p>
	<p><center><h2>Student Created</h2></center></p>
<p>This method would work best with older students. Say, for example, they are reading <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; Shakespeare is pretty complex! The following are some examples students can do:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>write and film appropriate (even modernized) adaptations of scenes from the play;</li>
		<li>create social media profiles for the characters, or even write blogs as the characters;</li>
		<li>create music playlists for characters (and be able to explain why those songs were chosen).</li> 
	</ul>
<p>All of these together tell the story and expand on the characters and world of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and help allow students to better grasp the complexities of the original text. And these can be shared with the other students, as well, to put together one giant transmedia project.</p>
