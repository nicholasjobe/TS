	<p><em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> is the seventh and final book in the franchise. It takes place almost entirely outside of Hogwarts, with the exception of the third act and climax.</p>

		<p><center><strong><h1>The Movie</h1></strong></center></p>
	<p><em>Deathly Hallows</em> is the first and only book in the franchise to be split into two films (though many concede <em>Goblet of Fire</em> should have been, as well). Both films are highly regarded and include most important details from the book outside of Dumbledore's personal history, which is delved into quite a bit in the book.</p>
